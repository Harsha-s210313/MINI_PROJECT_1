# MINI_PROJECT_1
We developed a cooperative swarm-based street light control system featuring vehicle interaction. Our project enables street lights to communicate dynamically, adjusting brightness based on real-time traffic to save energy while ensuring safety. This repository contains the source code and simulation data for our implementation.
